ReadWriteLock -- A lock with shared/exclusive access modes

=head1 SYNOPSIS

=begin code :lang<raku>

use ReadWriteLock;

my $l = ReadWriteLock.new;

my $thread-a = Thread.start({
    $l.lock-shared();
    for ^5 {
        sleep 1;
        say "thread A doing something under protection of the lock";
    }
    $l.unlock();
});

my $thread-b = Thread.start({
    $l.protect-shared({
        for ^5 {
            sleep 1;
            say "thread B doing something under protection of the lock";
        }
    });
});

my $thread-c = Thread.start({
    $l.protect-exclusive({
        for ^5 {
            sleep 1;
            say "thread C doing something under exclusive protection of the lock";
        }
    });
});

$thread-a.join;
$thread-b.join;
$thread-c.join;

=head1 FEATURES

=item Does what a basic C<Lock> does, just slower and with more bugs ;)

=item Reentrant: the lock can be taken again by a thread that is already holding it It needs to be unlocked the same number of times it was locked before it can be taken by another thread

=item Fair in the sense of first-come-first-serve

=item Shared access: multiple 'readers' can share the lock, yet access is mutually exclusive between 'readers' and 'writers'

=item Lock Upgrade: you can upgrade a shared access mode to an exclusive without unlocking first, if no other thread is interferring. In this case you do not need to unlock twice.

=head1 PLANNED FEATURES

=item Read-for-write access mode that guarantees that a lock upgrade can be taken

=item Async version that returns threads to the threadpool and returns a promise from lock()

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module implements a lock/mutex with shared and exclusive access modes,
so a set of 'readers' could share the lock while 'writers' need exclusive
access. The lock is reentrant, so can be taken multiple times by the same
thread, and fair in the sense of come-first-server-first.

Please note that locks of whatever kind are a very low-level synchronisation
mechanism and inherently difficult to use correctly, where possible
higher-level mechanisms like a C<Channel>, C<Promise> or C<Suppply> should
be used.

=head1 EXAMPLES

=head2 Constructor

=begin code :lang<raku>

use ReadWriteLock;

my $l = ReadWriteLock.new;

=end code

Constructing a ReadWriteLock is very simple and takes no arguments.

=head2 Protecting a Code segment

=begin code :lang<raku>

$l.protect-shared: {
    # code thunk
}

$l.protect-exclusive: {
    # code thunk
}

$l.protect: shared, {
    # code thunk
}

$l.protect: exclusive, {
    # code thunk
}

=end code

The C<protect()> usage pattern has the distinct benefit that it automatically
unlocks in case of e.g. exceptions or whenever the code block is being left. You
can either use the 'long' form like C<protect-shared()>, which is nice and
implicit, or pass the access mode in as an argument, which allows determning it
from a function and passing it around.

=head2 Direct locking/unlocking

=begin code :lang<raku>

$l.lock-shared;

$l.lock-exclusive;

$l.lock(shared);

$l.lock(exclusive);

$l.unlock;

=end code

Alternatively you can also use stand-alone lock/unlock calls, which allows
tricky usages like overhand locking etc, but requires more care to be safe. If
you lock multiple times, you need to unlock a matching number of times before
the lock becomes available again.

=head2 Lock Upgrades

=begin code :lang<raku>

$l.lock-shared;

# do something

$l.lock-exclusive;

# do something else that requires exclusive access

$l.unlock;

=end code

You can upgrade a lock that you are holding in shared mode to an exclusive
access, as long as no other thread was traying to do the same before (You will
get an exception in that case). In this case you only need to unlock once, the
lock has been upgraded not re-entered.
